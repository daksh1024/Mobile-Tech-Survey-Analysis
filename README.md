# Mobile-Tech-Survey-Analysis
Telephonic survey analysis and participants demographic prediction

## Introduction

The impact of mobile phones and technology on emerging economic countries has been transformative.In order to better understand the role of technology in our society, we analyze the results of PewResearch's "Mobile and Technology - 2018" telephone survey. This survey focuses on three key areas: how people use their mobile phones, the impact of social media and technology, and how these factors intersect with politics. Through this analysis, we gain a thorough understanding of the benefits and drawbacks that technology brings to our lives. We also forecast an individual's perspective on their standard of living based on their demographic details and overall political inclinations using ML models such as LDA, PCA, t-SNE, and SVC.
